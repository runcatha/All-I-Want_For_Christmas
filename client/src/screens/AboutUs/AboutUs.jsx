        <p>Wouldn't it be nice if you could get your friends and family exactly what they want for Christmas? 

Also, isn't it the worst that throughout the year you think of things that would be nice to recieve as gifts, but when someone askes you what you want you draw a blank? 

Have no fear because All I Want for Christmas is here to solve these problems and more! Create a profile and add items that you want as they come to mind. When the holidays roll around go to your friends/families member's profiles to pick out exactly what they want.</p>
